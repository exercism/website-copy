    "bio": "I am drawn to Elm because it is a safe, reliable, and refactorable alternative to building webapps. It's an approachable language that not only supports the dynamic nature of greenfield projects, but it can also be adopted in small steps within legacy apps implemented in other front-end solutions."

    "bio": "I'm a software lead / architect / manager type thing and I have a strong focus on code quality. Elm is the first functional language I've learned and it's impressively easy. The language has a strong focus on simplicity and a single recommended way of doing things, which is a refreshing change in the Front End world. It sits very well in it's target niche, and the runtime essentially provides an impure abstract syntax tree interpreter, leaving all your code 100% pure / functional. There is a strong and vibrant community, which is both innovative and supportive to newcomers."
