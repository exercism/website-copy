I enjoy learning about and debating ethics and philosophy. What I lack in formal education in these fields I make up for in curiosity and open-mindedness. I'm currently looking to get started with competitive programming and using Exercism to practice. I hope to accelerate people's progression through the Elixir track, as there is currently a huge lack in mentors and I'm sure it's frustrating people to wait many days for their code to be reviewed (although it does prepare us well for the realities of business :P)."
