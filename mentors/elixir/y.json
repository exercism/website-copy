    "bio": "I chanced upon Elixir back in early 2014 when we were looking out for a replacement stack that is as pleasant and productive to work in as Ruby, while giving us the reliability and fault-tolerance of Erlang, without having to add too much external dependencies to scale out our Ruby stack product."
