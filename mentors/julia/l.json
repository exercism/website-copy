  "bio": "I started using Julia when I was getting started as a Software Engineering Intern at NASA. Since then, I have gone on to Intern with Julia Computing on the PumasAI project, win a new Julia Language contributor award for 2019, and authored a few small packages. The Julia programming language and community are incredible. I am looking forward to helping more in the future."
