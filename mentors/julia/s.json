    "bio": "I've been programming for 47 years, always focusing on performance.  I love learning both computer and human languages, my favorites are Scheme, CLU, and now Julia. I respect C as a great tool over the years, now I want to learn Rust to complement Julia,  which I've been using 100% of the time (professionally & developing open source packages) for over 5 years, since version 0.3. I am the creator of the JuliaString.org GitHub organization"
