    "bio": "When you can remember a time when the only way to interact with a computer was via the CLI, you learn to love it and quite frankly I do love it.  I have been using both bash style and zsh style shells on Mac and various Linux distros for almost a decade.  Prior to my current career as a MEAN stack developer, I was an undergraduate professor of chemistry and gained a tremendous amount of experience with bash shell scripts to automate and run analytical chemistry based lab instrumentation.  I love to learn form others and help others learn and would love to get you bash obsessed!"
