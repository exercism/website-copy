Whenever I have something I need to automate, Bash is one of my go-tos - its flexibility and interesting syntax make it one of my favorite languages to write. Having direct access to command-line utilities within scripts makes Bash appealing by itself, but the language is so much more than just that. I look forward to helping others learn it!"
