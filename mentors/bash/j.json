    "bio": "Bash is one of the first languages encountered by a *nix newcomer. It has a unique position in the programming ecosystem as both the interactive shell and as a fully-fledged programming language. One can do amazing things with it, as long as one accepts the need to be somewhat disciplined in order to handle the sometimes gnarly syntax.  I've been a command line *nix hacker for over 25 years and I am happy to assist others on their quest for shell mastery."
