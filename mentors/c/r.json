    "bio" : "I am currently a PhD Student in CSE at University of California - San Diego. My interests are in Machine Learning & Embedded Systems. I love programming in C. It was the first language I learnt. I work a lot in systems and hence write a lot of firmware code in C. I've started using Python as well for ML applications. Outside of research I enjoy reading and outdoor activities."
