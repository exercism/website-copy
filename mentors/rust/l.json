    "bio": "After many years of writing hobby projects in C++ and school- and professional project in C# and JavaScript, my new go-to language has become Rust. As a perfect blend of a low-level language with high-level syntax features it's become the language I get most joy using, and hopefully I help others find enjoyment in it too."

    "bio": "I've been a developer for well over a decade now, with a mastery of C++, Python, Javascript, and (recently) Rust. For someone who's always loved C++'s emphasis on zero-cost abstraction and RAII semantics, Rust has been a basically flawless expression of my own design sensibilities. I've always had a passion for helping & teaching others, so feel free to come to me with any Rust questions you might have."
