Unless it makes the code more readable, repetition should be avoided.
Try to find the _minimal conditional_ to make the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Note: DRY isn't always better. It may sometimes be better to duplicate code snippets rather than to introduce 
unnecessary complexity just to avoid duplication.
