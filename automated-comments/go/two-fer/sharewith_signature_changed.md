The signature of the `ShareWith` function should be `ShareWith(name string) string`.
Exercism is built on the TDD (Test Driven Development) principle. 
The tests already exist and define the outward facing interface as well as the behaviour of the code to be implemented.
Changing the signature will break the tests.
