Replace the stub comments with a brief, but helpful, description of the package, and a sentence or two explaining what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns. `
Accurate, helpful comments on how to use the code, are very important to Go developers. 
This is a great guide to writing good comments: [Effective Go: Commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary).
The `godoc` tool produces documentation from the code comments automatically, when executed.
See [godoc.org](https://godoc.org) for examples of what this looks like.
