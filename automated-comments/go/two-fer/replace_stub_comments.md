Replace the stub comments with a brief, but helpful, description of the package, and a sentence or two explaining what the function does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns.
Accurate, helpful comments on how to use the code, are very important to Go developers.
This is a great guide to writing good comments: [Effective Go: Commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary).
The `godoc` tool produces documentation from the code comments automatically, when executed.
See [godoc.org](https://godoc.org) for examples of what this looks like.
