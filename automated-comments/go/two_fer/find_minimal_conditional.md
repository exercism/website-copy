Currently you are repeating most of the output string. This is OK, but in general, Go programmers try to avoid duplicating code where they can avoid it. Can you work out how to restructure your code so that you don't repeat yourself (DRY)?

Note: DRY isn't always better. It may sometimes be better to duplicate small things than to introduce unnecessary complexity just to avoid duplication.
