When your function returns an `error`, this tells the caller that the other return value shouldn't be used. 
Since it doesn't actually matter what you return in that case, the convention is to return the [zero value](https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value).
In languages that don't allow multiple return values from functions, you often need to use an invalid 'out-of-band' value to signal an error, such as `-1`. That's not necessary in Go.
