Go is a programming language where returning as soon as possible and multiple times from a function or method 
is practiced a lot. It keeps code readable and maintainable.

Usually one would handle edge cases first and error cases as soon as they occur by returning. This practice is
nicely explained in the blog post [Align the happy path to the left edge](https://medium.com/@matryer/line-of-sight-in-code-186dd7cdea88) by Mat Ryer.
You can also watch the talk he gave on the toppic.
  
Can you apply this to your solution?
