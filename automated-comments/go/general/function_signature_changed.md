Fix the signature of the `%{function}` function. The expected signature is `%{signature}`.
Exercism is built on the TDD ([Test Driven Development](http://testfirst.org/about#tdd)) principle.
The tests already exist and define the outward facing interface, as well as the behaviour of the code to be implemented.
Changing the signature breaks the tests.
