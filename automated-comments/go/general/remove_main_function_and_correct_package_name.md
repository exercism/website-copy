I see you declared a function `main` to run your code. Exercism is using TDD (Test Driven Development).
That means the code is usually executed by running the tests. You can run the tests with `go test` from the terminal.
The tests are also a measure for you if your code is correct or not.

Remove the `main` function and rename the package name back to `twofer` if you changed that too. Then run the tests.
