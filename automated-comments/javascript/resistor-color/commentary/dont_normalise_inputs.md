It's always fine to be defensive about inputs, so that a program will run 
correctly under more circumstances. However, arbitary input normalisation is 
discouraged on Exercism. Later exercises will have defined inputs that are 
denormalised where we'll expect sanitizing and normalising the input. Keep it 
simple for now.
