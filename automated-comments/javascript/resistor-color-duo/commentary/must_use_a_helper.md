Mentor the student to add helper function and DRY-up this solution. The solution 
to `resistor-color` can be used as helper method here. When using an `Array` as 
colors source, in a years time, will the student recall why it's the _index_ in 
that array? When using an `Object`, what does the value mean? 

Re-using `colorCode` explains this in both cases.
