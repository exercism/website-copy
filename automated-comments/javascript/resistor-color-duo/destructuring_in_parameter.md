The [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) also works directly in parameters, such as
`%{parameter}`. This allows for giving a name to the items inside the parameter, 
limit how many items come in and replace the more cryptic numeric indexers with 
the named items.
