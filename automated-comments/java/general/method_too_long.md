Consider breaking down the following method(s) into calls to other semantically meaningful methods: `%<methodNames>s`

The method has more lines of code than this exercise generally requires.
This might be acceptable, but it could be an indication that the method is doing too much work directly and should be delegating some of that work to other methods.
Try to keep everything inside a method at one level of abstraction.
For example, iterating through the elements of a loop could be in one method while manipulating each individual element could be in another.
