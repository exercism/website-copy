The tests indicate that the constructor ought to be throwing IllegalArgumentExceptions with specific error messages.
Make sure the constructor throws if the inputs have different lengths.

NOTE: An IllegalArgumentException is not a checked exception so it does not need a `throws` statement on the constructor (or any other methods).
