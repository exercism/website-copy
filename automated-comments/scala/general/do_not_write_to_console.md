Remove the functions(s) that write to the console, as the tests don't require them and they make the code slightly harder to read.

Usually, these statements are added to help debug the code. However, a better approach is to debug the code while running one or more unit tests. This has the added advantage that one can focus on debugging a specific test case. Here are some links that explain how to debug Scala code while running unit tests in various IDE's:
