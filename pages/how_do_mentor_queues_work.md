# How mentor queues work

Mentors are free to choose whichever submissions they want to mentor.
Normally, though, they work through either a track's queue (e.g. all the Ruby submissions), or an exercise's queue (e.g. all the Ruby High-Scores submissions).

Queues are ordered algorithmically, but fundamentally act like first-in-first-out queues with core exercises prioritized over side exercises, and those submitted in "Mentored Mode" prioritized over those in "Practice Mode".

We provide time estimates for Core Exercises based on the median response time over recent weeks. Because there is no strict linear queue, and because mentors' rates of mentoring and mentoring behavior changes daily, these estimates should be treated as our "best guess", rather than any guarantee.
However, as a yardstick, the quickest tracks provide mentoring within a few hours, and the slowest within a few days.
