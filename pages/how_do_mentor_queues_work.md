Mentors are free to choose whichever submissions they want to mentor.
Normally, though, they work through either a track's queue (e.g. all the Ruby submissions), or an exercise's queue (e.g. all the Ruby High-Scores submissions).

Queues are ordered algorithmically, but fundamentally acts like first-in-first-out queues with core exercises prioritized over side exercises, and those submitted in "Mentored Mode" prioritized over those in "Practice Mode".

Because there is no strict linear queue, and because mentors' rates of mentoring and mentoring behavior changes daily, we currently do not provide time estimates.
However, as a yardstick, the quickest tracks provide mentoring within a few hours, and the slowest within a few days.
