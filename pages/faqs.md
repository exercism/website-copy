### What's with the name "Exercism"?

Despite being one vowel away from "exorcism", the name has nothing to do with demons or fixing "evil code".

Instead, it's a pun on exercise. The way Katrina came to think about each exercise is that they are small, trivial, and seemingly simple. However, when it comes to solving an exercise, the devil is often in the details. In other words, that simple exercise is suddenly more challenging once you think about the finer details.

### Who is behind Exercism?

Exercism was founded by [Katrina Owen](http://www.kytrinyx.com/). Katrina is a polyglot developer and Ruby Hero award winner who accidentally became a developer while pursuing a degree in molecular biology. She began nitpicking code back in 2006 while volunteering at JavaRanch, and got hooked. When programming, her focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and refactoring. She cares deeply about open source and contributes to several projects outside of exercism.

In 2016, Katrina decided that for Exercism to fulfil it's potential it needed a professional product team to rethink the Exercism from the ground up. She joined forces with [Thalamus](http://thalamus.ai) and over 8 months, led by [Nicole Chalmers](https://twitter.com/n_chalmers), they reconceived Exercism as the fully-flegded product you see today.

In addition to this core team, Exercism is made possible by hundreds of wonderful volunteers who have crafted the various language tracks and exercises that made Exercism so popular.
