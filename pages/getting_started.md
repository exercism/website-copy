# Getting Started

## Help! What do I do?

We know using a new product can be daunting, and Exercism is a little complicated. So here's a really simple set of instructions to get you started.  

### Sign up  
1. Sign up at exercism.io using either your GitHub account, or by using your email address and choose a password.
2. If you sign up using an email address, you now need to confirm it. Look for the email, click the link, then log in.

#### Language and exercises  
3. You will now see a list of all the [language tracks](/tracks) you can join. You can click through as many as you want to explore.
4. Once you've found a language you want to join, click the "Join Track" button.
5. You will now be taken into your new track. You'll see a core set of exercises at the top and some side-exercises below.
6. Start with the first **core** exercise on the track, which is normally called "Hello World". Click on the exercise to begin.
7. You will see some information and some instructions on the left-hand side and a button on the right-hand side labelled "Begin Walkthrough". Click on this and follow the instructions.

#### Submit your solution, mentoring  
8. You should now have the CLI installed and the exercise downloaded to your computer. Solve the exercise and then upload it using `exercism submit /PATH/TO/SOLUTION`
9. In your web-browser, go back to the [language tracks](/tracks) page, choose your exercise and the exercise you've just worked on. You will now see your solution online and notice that it is awaiting a mentor.
10. A mentor will now come and give you feedback on your solution. This can happen really quickly (15 minutes) or take a little while (a day or two) depending on demand. In the meantime, you will find other exercises on your track are available for you to solve!

#### Iterations, resubmit 
11. Once you've received feedback, you can make some changes to your solution and then resubmit it (see step 8). This may happen a couple of times before the solution is approved. 
12. Once the solution is approved by a mentor, you click 'complete' to mark the solution completed. This will unlock lots more exercises.

#### Get involved: mentoring or maintaining a track    
13. You're now an Exercism pro! :)
14. Fancy giving back to Exercism and helping others? We always need more [mentors](http://mentoring.exercism.io) and [track maintainers](/become-a-maintainer) and we'd love you to get involved!
