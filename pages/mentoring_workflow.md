# Mentoring Workflow

## Navigating the Mentor Dashboard
To get started with mentoring, log into your Exercism account and click on “Mentor Dashboard” in the main menu.

You will see your Mentor Dashboard which lists solutions that have been submitted by learners and are ready for mentor feedback. Here you can filter the solutions by Status, Track (language) or Exercise. We recommend using the “Exercise” filter so you can give feedback on multiple solutions while a particular exercise is fresh in your mind.

The right hand side shows how many solutions you’ve mentored so far so you can see how your hard work is helping out the community.

Click on one of the solutions to start giving feedback. This will take you to the mentor feedback interface where you can write and submit your feedback.

## Giving Mentor Feedback 

You can click the “Instructions” tab to remind yourself of what the exercise is about. These are the same instructions given to the learner.

The "Test Suite" tab shows the tests that the user has made pass in order to solve the exercise.

The “Solution” tab is the code the learner has submitted for feedback. The iteration number is shown in the top right corner.

We recommend taking a look at the learners previous iterations so you can see their progress and give helpful feedback which considers their journey.

Under "Mentor Discussion" you will see two tabs where you can write your feedback and preview what you've written.

Once you're happy with the feedback you've written, click "Comment". If you're not sure what feedback to give, paste a link to the solution (e.g. https://exercism.io/mentor/solutions/...) on the relevant language channel on Slack and brainstorm some ideas with other mentors.

If you come across a solution you don't want to give feedback to, you can click the "I'll pass, thanks" button and you won't ever see the solution in your Mentor Dashboard queue again.

_Note: this button is labeled as `Leave conversation` for solutions you are actively mentoring.  Clicking this button will return the solution to the mentor queue for another mentor to assume._

When you think a learner has learnt enough from the exercise (i.e. they've touched upon a couple of concepts and made good progress with each iteration based on the feedback given), you can allow the learner to progress by clicking on the "Approve and comment" button (appears when you type). You will need to add a comment before hitting this button, for example "It looks like you've learnt enough from this exercise, great work."

![approve](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5421823/42646486-eecd1a3e-85f8-11e8-92de-d7d34298a3f6.png)

Once you have submitted your comment you can go back to the Mentor Dashboard and choose another solution to give feedback on.
