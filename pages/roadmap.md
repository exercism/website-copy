## Coming as soon as possible

### Teams

We are building a dedicated site for teams. It will allow groups of people to complete exercises and mentor each other in a private space. We envision it being used by bootcamps, groups of friends, and colleagues at work. Teams on Exercism v1 was a really important feature for many people so restoring it is a top priority for us.

**Status:** Close to launching. Ironing out the last bugs.

### Merging the Javascript and ECMAScript tracks

We have decided to merge the Javascript and ECMAScript tracks. This will mean we can focus the work of the maintainers and mentors into one place, and improve the quality of our offering. 

**Status:** We have a good plan for this with a couple of issues to iron out. [Tracking issue](https://github.com/exercism/javascript/issues/556)

### Fixing bugs

There are still loads of little issues that need resolving from the launch of v2. Anything tagged with `type/bug` on the exercism/exercism repo needs sorting. You can explore that list [here](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Fbug).

## Next up

### Merging mentoring.exercism.io into the main site

We want to streamline the sign up process, to remove the Google Form and the need to join slack to mentor. We have some challenges to do this, such as ensuring there is quality control before someone can go wild mentoring, but we have some ideas as to how to achieve this.

### Mentoring UI Improvements

- Bringing the communal mentoring notes from GitHub to be visible directly within the UI.
- Personalise mentor notes per exercise, viewable and editable within the UI.
- Adding 'Comment and Request changes' to mentoring UI, which will prompt the learner to submit another iteration (a little like Code Review on GitHub)
- Add difficulty filter to solution selector
- Show more information (such as track backlog) on the dashboard
