This is a rough guide of our roadmap for the next year. It's aim is to show priority order and when we hope to release new features. This list is in no-way comprehensive. Specifically it doesn't cover the huge amount of work that the maintainers put into improving the different tracks on the site. All times are estimates and may change at the whim of the people doing the work.

### One day - two weeks

- **Teams:** We are building a dedicated site for teams. It will allow groups of people to complete exercises and mentor each other in a private space. We envision it being used by bootcamps, groups of friends, and colleagues at work. Teams on Exercism v1 was a really important feature for many people so restoring it is a top priority for us. We are close to launching and ironing out the last bugs.

- **Fixing bugs:** There are still loads of little issues that need resolving from the launch of v2. Anything tagged with `type/bug` on the exercism/exercism repo needs sorting. You can explore that list [here](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atype%2Fbug).

### One week - two months

- **Make the website responsive:** This is a big job with a [WIP PR](https://github.com/exercism/website/pull/252).

- **Save comments in local storage** We want to save comments into local storage as they're being written so that if a user accidently navigates off the page, they are stored. [#4312](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4312)

- **Add a button for mentors to report learners** [#4306](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4306)

- **Merging mentoring.exercism.io into the main site:** We want to streamline the sign up process, to remove the Google Form and the need to join slack to mentor. We have some challenges to do this, such as ensuring there is quality control before someone can go wild mentoring, but we have some ideas as to how to achieve this.

- **Mentoring UI Improvements:**
  - Exposing the communal mentoring notes from GitHub to be visible directly within the UI.
  - Adding personalised mentor notes per exercise, viewable and editable within the UI. [#4083](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4083)
  - Adding 'Comment and Request changes' to mentoring UI, which will prompt the learner to submit another iteration (a little like Code Review on GitHub)
  - Adding difficulty filter to solution selector [#4105](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4105)
  - Showing more information (such as track backlog) on the dashboard [#4032](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4032)
  - Improve mentoring notifications [#3883](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/3883)

- **Add ability to change which solutions are published:** Currently, you cannot change which solutions are published. We will enable this. [#4163](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4163)

- **Enable commenting on community solutions:** We are going to let people decide whether want comments enable on a per solution basis.

- **Download link on all iterations** Add the download link and a link to instructions on all iterations in the student's view. [#4259](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4259)

- **Delete my account:** We need to give people the ability to delete their account without emailing Jeremy.

- **Improve experience of legacy or indepedent solutions in mentored mode:** When importing from legacy or independent mode have sepererate restricted queues for core and side exercises.

- **Allow deletion of iterations:** Often people submit iterations by default. This will allow people to delete them. [#3848](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/3848)

- **Allow users to change which iteraton is published:** At the moment only the most recent submisison is published. We will allow users to choose any of the iterations to make public.

### Two months - three months

- **Changelog:** We want to add a changelog into the site that all maintainers and contributors can add to. Rather than being a static page, this will be a functional product. We envisage that a maintainer would submit an entry saying "We've added a new exercise called XYZ to the ABC track". This would then appear on the changelog with a nice track icon, and the Track's twitter account (yes, every track will have its own account) will then tweet that out. The changelog will be filterable by track or topic and have built in searching.

- **Define a public API:** We want to define a public API that will allow other to integrate Exercism into their code editors [#4087](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4087).

- **Automated testing on the real site:** We want to create true integration tests that run against production that test sign up, track creation, mentoring and then delete the user. These will run after each deploy of both new code and changes to a track to ensure nothing has broken.

- **Improve maintainer tools:** We want to update the new website to allow for an easy and pleasent experience for track maintainers and will build out tools within the UI to allow them to more easily experiment with track setups.

- **Improve accessibility:** There are various a11y improvements we are making, spearheaded by [@unused's plan here](https://github.com/exercism/website/pull/182).

### Three months - six months

- **Generate a examplar syllabus for the sample tracks:** We are actively working to explore what an examplar syllabus would look like for the Ruby track, considering things such as  learning pathways, goals, mentoring-burden. We will then explore where the gaps are and what new exercises might be created as part of this. Once we have made some basic progress we will widen the discussion to include a small set of sample tracks with active maintainers.

- **Provide automatic code analysis of submissions:** We used to have a bot called Rikki that used the [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) to work out what anti-patterns were being used and provide an automatic comment. We want to evolve this to provide a suggested comment to mentors that they can give to students (we may sometimes choose to make it automatic - we need to explore this futher). We imagine using a mixture of Machine Learning and AST analysis to do this and will probably prototype it on 1-3 tracks first.

### Beyond six months

- **Allowing exercises to be completed online:** Remove the requirement to install the CLI allow people to complete the exercises and run the tests on the Exercism website. This will also allow us to automatically run tests against submitted code to test that it works and help mentors.

- **Multi-lingual support:** We really want to support multiple languages, but doing this is a huge, complex project, which would involve translating the exercises, website, etc as well as being able to recruit mentors into a specific language. We're currently exploring what a first stage of this might look like for PT-BR [here](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4207).
