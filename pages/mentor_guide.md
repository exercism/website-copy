To get started with mentoring log into your Exercism account, and click on “Mentor Dashboard” in the main menu (IMAGE).

You will see you Mentor Dashboard which lists solutions that have been submitted by a learner that are ready for mentor to give feedback. Here you can filter the solutions by Status, Track (language) or Exercise. We recommend using the “Exercise” filter so you can give feedback on multiple solutions while a particular exercise is fresh in your mind.

The right hand side shows how many solutions you’ve mentored so far so you can see how your hard work if you’re helping out the community.

Click on one of the solutions to start giving feedback. This will take you to the mentor feedback interface where you can write and submit your feedback.

You can click the the “Instructions” tab to remind yourself of what the exercise is about. (IMAGE)

The “Test Suite” tab (IMAGE)

The “Solution” tab is the code you the learner has submitted for feedback from a mentor. The iteration number is shown in the top right corner. We recommend taking a look at the learners previous iterations so you can see their process and give helpful feedback which considers their journey. (IMAGE)
