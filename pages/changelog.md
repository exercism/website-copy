Marked a notification as read but want to still see it? We've added a button for "All notifications" that allows you to see both read and unread notifications. Credit to [@PatrickMcSweeny](https://github.com/PatrickMcSweeny).

### [Website] Comments auto-save as typed

Nothing is more frustrating than losing your work. To stop accidental tab-closes or refreshes, we've added autosaving as you type comments. Simply go back to the page and you'll find your text is still there!. Credit to [@jackhughesweb](https://github.com/jackhughesweb).

### [Website] Added Dark Theme to the code editor
