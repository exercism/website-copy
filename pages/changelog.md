# Changelog

## [Website]- Add ability to change which solutions are published:

Previously, you could not change which solutions are published. We have now enabled this along with the ability to choose which appear on the profile and which allow public comments. [#4163](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4163)

## [Website] Add communal mentoring notes
We have exposed the communal mentoring notes from GitHub to be visible directly within the UI.

## [Teams] Launch the site

We have built a dedicated site for teams. It allows groups of people to complete exercises and mentor each other in a private space. We envision it being used by bootcamps, groups of friends, and colleagues at work.

## [Website] Delete my account

We needed to give people the ability to delete their account without emailing Jeremy.

## [Website] Reset CLI token

We wanted to let people reset their CLI tokens in case they are leaked. [#4150](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4150)

## [Website] Improve experience of "Legacy" or "Practice" solutions in Mentored Mode

Have separate restricted queues for core and side exercises when importing solutions created in v1 or in Practice Mode.

## [Website] Make side-exercise mentoring opt-in:

At the moment some tracks have thousands of side-exercises in the backlog. We're going to change this behaviour so people have to opt-in to mentoring on an exercise-by-exercise basis and can only request mentoring on a handful of exercises at once.

## [Website] Put challenge back to mentor queue if mentor leaves conversation:
[#4308](https://github.com/exercism/exercism/issues/4308)

## [Website] Merge mentoring.exercism.io into the main site

We wanted to streamline the sign up process, to remove the Google Form and the need to join slack to mentor. This is the first step in a long list of changes we'll make to the mentoring onboarding process.

## [Website] Make the site responsive.

The Exercism website is now mobile-responsive thanks to this [huge Pull Request](https://github.com/exercism/website/pull/252) by [@jackhughesweb](https://github.com/jackhughesweb)..

## [Website] Add all notifications

Marked a notification as read but want to still see it? We've added a button for "All notifications" that allows you to see both read and unread notifications. Credit to [@PatrickMcSweeny](https://github.com/PatrickMcSweeny).

## [Website] Comments auto-save as typed

Nothing is more frustrating than losing your work. To stop accidental tab-closes or refreshes, we've added autosaving as you type comments. Simply go back to the page and you'll find your text is still there!. Credit to [@jackhughesweb](https://github.com/jackhughesweb).

## [Website] Added Dark Theme to the code editor

We have added a dark theme to the code editor. You can enable it in [your preferences](https://exercism.io/my/settings/preferences/edit). Credit to [@jackhughesweb](https://github.com/jackhughesweb).

## [Tracks] Merged the Javascript and ECMAScript tracks

We merged the Javascript and ECMAScript tracks with the aim of focussing the work of the maintainers and mentors into one place, and improve the quality of our offering.
