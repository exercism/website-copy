# Mentoring Getting Started

Hi new mentor! Awesome to see you here!

Most of us were a bit... shy..?... anxious...?....feeling inadequate..?... before we started mentoring, so we've written down some tips based on our own experiences to help you with your adventure in mentoring. Hope it helps!

## 1. Start with the early exercises
Your [dashboard](https://exercism.io/mentor/dashboard) lists the exercises. When you start as a mentor, we'd recommend to not follow the suggested order, but pick the starter exercises in the track, like the first core exercise (_TwoFer_ in most tracks), and the first side exercise (for Ruby: _Acronym_). You can find a list of all the side exercises on your own profile page. Or, ask your fellow mentors in the Slack track channel.

## 2. Solve the exercise yourself
This has multiple benefits:
- You'll know what new students experience when downloading exercises with the Exercism CLI
- You'll have to solve the exercise in a way that passes the tests - and nothing more.
- You can request mentoring ;-)

As the queues for side exercises in the tracks are huge, time-to-mentor can be long. You can either mentor yourself by reading the [Mentor Notes](https://github.com/exercism/website-copy/tree/main/tracks) if those are available, or ask your fellow mentors in the Slack channel for their favorite solutions, or ask them to look at your solution. You may want to add that you're asking because you want to start mentoring that exercise.

## 3. Mentor that exercise first
- In your Mentor Dashboard, filter the list of exercises for your track and the one exercise. Work through a bunch of the submissions for this exercise. It'll give you a feel for the different kinds of students that you'll meet in your track, and you'll be suprised by the wide variety of solutions that people submit. We encourage you to be picky :-) Nothing wrong with discarding the submissions you don't feel confident about.
- It pays off to record all your comments from the beginning; and start collecting some links to the most frequently used resources to point to.

## 4. Your time investment
- Mentors are asked to commit to one hour a week, and it is listed on the site that one hour equals 20 mentorings. When you start mentoring, it's impossible to meet that goal.
- If you're willing and able to give it more than one hour weekly in the beginning, it will bring you up to mentoring speed faster, but please don't measure your success against the numbers.
- If you're bound to one hour, start with only one student's submission, and follow that through until approval.
- When you build your mentoring experience, know the exercises better and have a collection of notes you can rely on, you'll be much faster. Even then, every once and a while a review can take longer.

## 5. Mentor Notes in your track
We try to add Mentor Notes for every exercise; it's a work in progress so there may not be any for the track or the exercise you're mentoring. If there are notes, a button 'View community mentoring notes' will appear on your mentor dashboard as soon as you select a submission to mentor.
Mentor Notes show one or more variants of acceptable solutions. Some also list common topics that your fellow mentors discuss in their mentoring, and/or common pitfalls.

## 6. Mentoring Tips: general
- Please do not approve a solution without any comment. Especially new programmers may have spent lots of time to get the tests pass. At least acknowledge that they managed to pass the tests.
- Prefer telling the student what you like about a solution rather than pass a judgement - even if it's a positive judgment.
- Be aware that your student may not be a native English speaker. If they seem to misunderstand your comments, try a different wording.

## 7. Mentoring Tips: early exercises
- When the logic in the solution does not meet the standards, give them one step to work on. It pays off to start with the most important thing. In these early exercises, try not to explain the Why's of the language. Link to tutorials or blogs aimed at beginners in the language that shows _how_ things are done. Even when it's showing the solution to the exercise ad verbatim.
- When it's only syntax things, you may approve the solution and list the issues. You may want to link to a style guide if that's available in your language. As opinions on style tend to differ a bit ;-), make it a suggestion, not a rule.
(For instance: "Unless you have strong opinions on style, I'd recommend following the Style Guide.")
We don't enforce a particular style guide; being consistent is the main concern here.
- In the next iteration, follow the pace of the student. When they changed only one thing, and didn't take into account the effect of that one change on the rest of the code, just give them one step more. When the one step lead to more in-depth changes, take it from there.

## 8. Mentoring tips: more advanced exercises
- When you're advancing to more advanced exercises, it's still worthwhile to work on a few submissions of the same exercise. When you've seen enough to understand the problems students run into, it gets easier (and faster)
- The goal is for students to learn and to become more fluent in the language, not per se to deliver the optimal solution. When a student's first submission is already correct and idiomatic, we'd like to challenge them to take it one level up. When a student's first submission is not meeting the standards of the language or the logic, the mentoring aims at getting them to a 'minimal viable solution'. That may take one or more iterations, and mentoring can stop when that goal is reached.
- Chances are you love your programming language as much as we love ours. It may be tempting to dive deep into the language's internals, and it's one of the aspects that adds to the mentoring fun. However, mentoring this way can also become a time consuming hobby. The choice is yours; we just don't want the mentoring to get overwhelming, so please know that mentoring doesn't _need_ to go that far.
- When a student's solution is over your head, or you're not sure how to react, don't hesitate to consult your fellow mentors in the Slack channel. They are a great bunch of people and are very supportive. And they know exactly how starting with mentoring feels :-)
