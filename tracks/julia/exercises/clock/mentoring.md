## Common suggestions

- It is preferred to use \``value(m)`\` rather than \``m.value`\` because fields are generally considered private in Julia. Defining an API in terms of functions makes it much easier for other structs to implement your interface or for you to refactor your stuff. You can import the function from Dates with \``using Dates: value`\`
- \``lpad`\` is totally fine, but if you're already familiar with the \`printf\` language from C or elsewhere, you might like to take a look at the \`Printf\` stdlib


## Things to watch out for

If the student has a field for both hours and minutes, then
the trickiest case is when minutes are less than and not a multiple of 60 (e.g. -61).
Students often end up doing something quite convoluted to solve this.

Students often use `%` or `rem` and a subtraction when `mod` is probably what they want.

Your humble correspondent thinks that this is best solved by converting the hours to minutes, as is done in OTDE's solution below.


## Fun tricks

You can define the subtraction in terms of unary negation and addition, like this:

````
```julia
-(c::Clock, m::Minute) = c + -m
```
````

## Example solutions

OTDE's solution

````
```julia
using Dates

struct Clock
    min::Int
    Clock(min) = new(mod(min, 60 * 24))
end

Clock(hour, min) = Clock(hour * 60 + min)

Base.:(+)(c::Clock, min::Minute) = Clock(c.min + value(min))
Base.:(-)(c::Clock, min::Minute) = Clock(c.min - value(min))

Base.show(io::IO, c::Clock) = print(io, '"', lpad(c.min รท 60, 2, '0'), ':', lpad(mod(c.min, 60), 2, '0'), '"')
```

If you choose not to convert everything into minutes,
then you have to handle the tricky case where minutes are less than 0 and not a multiple of 60.
There are various approaches to this.

ScottPJones' solution, which subtracts a \``Bool`\` (\``Bool`\`s are still integers):

````
```julia
using Dates: Minute, value

struct Clock
    h::UInt8
    m::UInt8
    Clock(h, m) = new(mod(h - (m < 0 && m % 60 != 0) + div(m, 60), 24), mod(m, 60))
end

Base.:+(x::Clock, y::Clock) = Clock(x.h + y.h + (x.m + x.m >= 60), x.m + y.m)

function Base.:+(x::Clock, y::Minute)
    h, m = divrem(value(y), 60)
    Clock(x.h + h, x.m + m)
end

Base.:-(x::Clock, y::Minute) = x + Minute(-value(y))

Base.show(io::IO, x::Clock) = print(io, '"', lpad(x.h, 2, '0'), ':', lpad(x.m, 2, '0'), '"')
```

dbalman's solution, using three mods and using \``@printf`\` rather than \``lpad`\`:

````
```julia
import Dates: Minute, value
using Printf: @printf

struct Clock
  hour::UInt8
  minute::UInt8
  Clock(hour, minute) =
    new(mod(hour + (minute - mod(minute, 60)) รท 60, 24),
        mod(minute, 60))
end

Base.:+(clock::Clock, minutes::Minute) =
  Clock(clock.hour, clock.minute + value(minutes))

Base.:-(clock::Clock, minutes::Minute) =
  Clock(clock.hour, clock.minute - value(minutes))

Base.show(io::IO, clock::Clock) =
  @printf(io, "\"%02d:%02d\"", clock.hour, clock.minute)
```

bovine3dom's solution which avoids the subtraction in dbalman's solution by using floor division:

````
```julia
import Dates
struct Clock
    hours::Int8
    minutes::Int8
    Clock(h,m) = new(rem(h + div(m,60,RoundDown),24,RoundDown),rem(m,60,RoundDown))
end

Base.:+(c::Clock,m::Dates.Minute) = Clock(c.hours, c.minutes + value(m))
Base.:-(c::Clock,m::Dates.Minute) = Clock(c.hours, c.minutes - value(m))
Base.:+(c::Clock,h::Dates.Hour) = Clock(c.hours + value(h), c.minutes)
Base.:-(c::Clock,h::Dates.Hour) = Clock(c.hours - value(h), c.minutes)

Base.show(io::IO, c::Clock) = print(io, '"', lpad(c.hours,2,'0'), ":", lpad(c.minutes,2,'0'), '"')
```
