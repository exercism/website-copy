## Advice

- Instead of writing out the whole alphabet, you can use a character range \``'a':'z'`\`, if you like.
- \``Iterators.partition`\` and `join` might be helpful for adding spaces between groups.
- Think about what happens to non-ascii input. What would you like to happen?

The reverse index into an array is given by

```julia
length(arr) - idx
```

Because alphabet characters are ordered in unicode, we can just do this with arithmetic:

```julia
idx = char - 'a' + 1
reverseidx = 26 - idx
newchar = 'a' + reverseidx
```

This works because a `Char` + an `Int` gives a new `Char` and a `Char` subtracted from another `Char` gives the number of codepoints between them. So `'c' - 'a' == 2` and `'a' + 2 == 'c'`.

We can simplify the code a little:

```julia
26 - (c - 'a' + 1) + 'a'
# Or, simplified again
25 - (c - 'a') + 'a'
# Or, simplified again (moving the first 'a' into the 25):
('z' - c) + 'a'
```


## Example solutions

An efficient procedural-style solution to this problem.
This code is verbose, but through that verbosity manages to read the input only once and allocates very little memory.

This is the kind of code you might write when you want more control in a hot loop or if you are used to writing in C, Go or Rust.
The verbosity means that all of the relevant logic for `encode` is within the function; you don't need to reference other functions and there's very little chance of accidentally introducing an extra loop.

The `IOBuffer` used here is a convenient way to create a string piece by piece. If you use the more naive approach of concatenating onto a string in a loop then you'll end up allocating many strings (each one is immutable, so concatenating two strings creates a third one).

This was slightly adapted from
[miguelraz and ScottPJones' solution](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia/exercises/atbash-cipher/solutions/037a4f733e734097a37b3287e84be40f)
by cmcaine.

```julia
function encode(input)
    buf = IOBuffer()
    # Every 6th character in output should be a space
    nextspace = 6
    for ch in input
        # Encode or exclude characters
        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z'
            ch = 'a' + ('z' - ch)
        elseif 'A' <= ch <= 'Z'
            ch = 'a' + ('Z' - ch)
        elseif '0' <= ch <= '9'
            # Pass through
        else
            continue # Exclude other chars
        end
        # Write a space if it's time
        nextspace -= 1
        if nextspace == 0
            # 5 rather than 6 because we're about to write two chars
            nextspace = 5
            write(buf, ' ')
        end
        write(buf, ch)
    end
    return String(take!(buf))
end

function decode(input)
    buf = IOBuffer()
    for ch in input
        if 'a' <= ch <= 'z'
            ch = 'a' + ('z' - ch)
        elseif ch == ' '
            continue
        end
        write(buf, ch)
    end
    return String(take!(buf))
end
```

This next approach emphasises that encoding and decoding are the same operation through code re-use.
We get a nice definition for encoding a single character (with a good output type that will force consumers to handle missing values explicitly)
and the `encode(str)` function is quite short and, if you are familiar with functional programming in Julia, fairly easy to read.

Compared to the more procedural approach above, this allocates more and performs extra work by creating various intermediate results that need to be transformed.

The code uses `missing` because unencodable values do go missing and because `skipmissing` is a handy built-in iterator.
I could also have used `nothing` and provided a function like `skipnothing(xs) = (x for x in xs if !isnothing(x))`.

Another nice functional solution by [halfdan](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia/exercises/atbash-cipher/solutions/419b6f4d04974a63b7f8531e8ad2808c).

Note, however, that this solution will mangle non-ascii letter characters and pass-through symbols, separators, etc.
Assuming that `isletter(c)` is the same as `c in 'a':'z' || c in 'A':'Z'` is quite common and can cause issues!
If you want your input to be ascii, use `ascii()`, `isascii()` or Strs.jl.

```julia
encode(input) = atbash(input, group=true)
decode(input) = atbash(input, group=false)

function atbash(input::AbstractString; group::Bool=false)
    input = [c for c in input if !(isspace(c) || ispunct(c))]
    result = join(map(atbash, input))
    if group
        join(map(join, Iterators.partition(result, 5)), ' ')
    else
        join(result)
    end
end

function atbash(c::Char)
    isletter(c) || return c
    'z' - (lowercase(c) - 'a')
end
```

A more data-oriented approach by [Nosferican](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia/exercises/atbash-cipher/solutions/4a06872ec87a4c91ab7c32e98682165e)

This looks quite dense, but if you read it carefully you'll see how it works and that there is very little to go wrong.
The only complicated code is the code to partition the ciphertext into blocks of 5, and that could be done by Iterators.partition.

```julia
const Cipher = Dict(zip(vcat('a':'z', 'A':'Z', '0':'9'),
                        vcat('z':-1:'a', 'z':-1:'a', '0':'9')))
encode(obj) = [ get(Cipher, x, "") for x ∈ obj if x ∈ keys(Cipher) ] |>
              (obj -> join((join(obj[idx:min(idx + 4, end)]) for idx ∈ 1:5:length(obj)),
                           " "))
decode(obj) = join(get(Cipher, x, "") for x in obj)
```
