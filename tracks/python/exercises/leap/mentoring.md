### Reasonable solutions

This is a nice, concise, very efficient solution:

```python
def is_leap_year(year):
  return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)
```

Some students are less comfortable with using `%` to mean "is divisible by" and find
something like the one below (from a student) easier to understand.
There is more overhead storing and loading from local variables, but
it's still O(1).

```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    divisible_by_4 = year % 4 == 0
    divisible_by_100 = year % 100 == 0
    divisible_by_400 = year % 400 == 0
    return divisible_by_4 and (not divisible_by_100 or divisible_by_400)
```

### Common suggestions
- there are just two cases that return True:
  - a year is a multiple of 4 *and not** 100
  - a year is a multiple of 4, 100, and 400
- For students interested in optimization, order of operations matter:
  - 75% of all years *cannot* be leap years because they are not mulitples of 4; test `year % 4 == 0` first
  - 98.97% of all leap years are multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 100; test `year % 100 != 0` second
  - 1.03% of all leap years are multiples of 4 that are also multiples of 100 and 400; test `year % 400 == 0` third
- and order of evaluation matters:
  ```python
  year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0
  ```
  _looks_ right, but will force a year like 999 to be checked for being a multiple of 400 unnecessarily
- eliminate duplicate work; no year should ever have to be checked multiple times for the same condition


### Talking points
- it's very helpful to internalize the rules Python uses for [expression order](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order)
- remember that **and** and **or** do not return **bool**, but instead:
  - **and** returns either the first term that is *considered* False, or the last term that is *considered* True
  - **or** returns either the first term that is *considered* True, or the last term that is *considered* False
