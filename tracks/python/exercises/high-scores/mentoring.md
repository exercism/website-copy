### Problem Summary and Challenges

This problem asks that students be familiar with **classes** and how they are created in Python.  In particular, the usage of **`__init__()`** , object attributes,  and the  **`self`** keyword.  The  **class** represents simple score tracking for a game, and should include:
- A constructor
- Attribute(s) to hold data
- Associated methods that return  **latest**  score, **personal_best** score, and **personal_top_three** scores.  

In tracking scores, students also use:
-  List indexing and slicing syntax
-  Strategies for computing/returning the maximum values in a list
-  Strategies for sorting/filtering lists 

  
### Reasonable Solutions
Canonical solution using the `max()` built-in to return `persona_best()`.
```python
class HighScores(object):
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def personal_best(self):
        return max(self.scores)

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]
```
Solution adding a `self.sorted_scores` attribute `sorted()` in reverse order.  `personal_best()` returns index zero of `self.sorted_scores` .
```python
class HighScores(object):
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores
        self.sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def personal_best(self):
        return self.sorted_scores[0]

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return self.sorted_scores[:3]
```
Solution adding a `self.sorted_scores` attribute that is `sorted()`.  `personal_best()` returns index **-1** of `self.sorted_scores` and `personal_top_three()` returns a slice from the right, using negative indexes.
```python
class HighScores(object):
    def __init__(self, scores):
        self.scores = scores
        self.sorted_scores = sorted(self.scores)

    def latest(self):
        return self.scores[-1]

    def personal_best(self):
        return self.sorted_scores[-1]

    def personal_top_three(self):
        return self.sorted_scores[:-4:-1]
```
Another variation of this solution includes the start at -1 for slicing the result to personal_top_three. The last solution works due the step being -1. Since no start is defined the start will default to 0 and the first step will start at -1 due to the step being defined.
```python
    def personal_top_three(self):
        return self.sorted_scores[-1:-4:-1]
```

### Common Suggestions

- Use **`sorted()`** over **`sort()`**.   `sorted()` returns a _**copy**_ , `sort()` _**mutates in place**_.  
  Solutions that use `sort()` without first _copying_ the data in `self.scores`  erase the "latest" score.  If `latest()` is called after the `sort()`, it will be inaccurate.
-  Use built-in functions like **`max(self.scores)`** -OR- **`sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[0]`**  over looping manually.   It's is more efficient than iterating through `self.scores` to find the largest value.
-  Using **`sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]`**  is preferable to  iterating through scores to find the three largest values.
- Checking  **`len(self.scores) < 3`**  is unnecessary if a list slice is used to make the three highest scores list.  Python will return a copy of the entire list if it is shorter than the requested list slice.
- A _negative index_ (e.g. **`self.scores[-1]`**) is preferred over performing a length-check  to get the index of the last element (e.g.**`self.scores[len(self.scores)-1]`**). 
- The syntax of  **`sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[:3]`** is preferred over  **`sorted(self.scores, reverse=True)[0:3]`**.  All slices default to zero unless otherwise specified - so convention is to leave it off.

  
### Talking Points

#### Copying Data and Lists
- Python is _pass by object reference_.  You cannot copy list data by assigning a new variable name, you must copy data by calling `.copy()` or using slice syntax `copied_data = data[:]`
- **Indexing and slicing work from either direction**.  Positive numbers from the left (starting at 0), negative numbers from the right (starting at -1).
- Why _wouldn't_ you use `heapq.nlargest` for getting the top three scores?  What other strategies could you use within the class to create and manage the "top three" scores?  How does your strategy change if there are incoming scores to manage on top of the existing scores?

  
#### Classes
-  **`__init__()`** is the constructor for the class.  Anything written inside of **`__init()__`**  executes _**once**_ -- when someone "makes a new object":  `my_scores = HighScores()`.   If this class needs to handle additional _incoming_ scores, what strategies and issues would the student need to think about because of this?
- **`self`** is a keyword that represents an _**object instance**_.  Any methods (including `__init__()`) intended to "belong" to an object  need `self` as their first argument.
-  `self` also denotes _**object attributes**_  :  `self.scores`, `self.sorted_scores`.  Data variables meant to be part of an object need `self` as part of their declaration.   Object attribute values can be changed _**per instance**_.  What are the potential downsides to this?
- Code inside methods runs _**on request**_.  Object methods are accessed from _outside_ the class using "dot notation" and the _**object instance name**_  (e.g. `my_scores.personal_top() ` or `my_scores.latest()`).  Object methods are accessed from _inside_ the class via `self`:  `self.personal_top()`, `self.latest()`.  What are the upsides/downsides of having code run on request vs running on instantiation?
- In Python 3.5 and above, classes can be declared without `(object)` because it's **inferred**.  The parenthesis & class name only need to be included when you are inheriting directly from a class that's _**not**_ `object`.  The boilerplate has the `(object)` syntax for backward compatibility.
