The point of this exercise is to get them going after the "hello-world"
exercise, create a file (by checking the test) and figuring out how to work
the `.test` files. It's supposed to teach students:

- [`default values` for parameters][ref-default-value]
- [`template literals`][ref-template-literal].

### Reasonable Solutions

There is only one reasonable form of solution, where the method of exporting or
defining the function can be different.

#### Static method on a class

```typescript
export default class TwoFer {
  static twoFer(name: string = 'you'): string {
    return `One for ${name}, one for me.`
  }
}
```

#### Property on the default export object

```javascript
export default {
  twoFer(name: string = 'you'): string {
    return `One for ${name}, one for me.`
  }
}
```

#### Approvability

You should **_only approve_** this if it matches the solutions above,
with a few exceptions where you may be lenient:

- a student uses CommonJS style `module.exports`
- a student omitted the return type `: string`
- a student omitted the parameter type `: string`

In all these cases, suggest they make a change (e.g. use ES6 style exports),
approve the submission and tell the student they can move on or improve:

  I'm approving your current submission so you can continue down the track, but
  feel free to iterate, improve and submit another solution. I will continue to
  mentor your future iterations.

### Common suggestions

This is the first mentored exercise, so you may use this to determine a
student's skill, help them set up their test suite, and generally point out
certain things. In the JavaScript track, this exercise is not meant to be a
barrier so in general, don't be harsh but set the tone for the rest of the
mentored track.

Here is a template you can copy with a few example comments. The goal of this
exercise is to have them remove any conditional _and_ use a template literal.

    Hi there {name},

    Congrats on submitting your first exercise for the JavaScript
    track. I have a few comments for you:

    - In TypeScript, the result of an expression can be returned!
      ```typescript
      let result: any
      if (name === undefined) {
        result = 'One for you, one for me.'
      } else {
        result = `One for ${name}, one for me.`
      }
      return result
      ```
      Given the example above, you can rewrite this to:
      ```typescript
      if (name === undefined) {
        return 'One for you, one for me.'
      }
      return `One for ${name}, one for me.`
      ```
    - Have you considered using a [default value][ref-default-value] for the
      parameter `name`? That way you don't need a conditional at all!

#### Literal instead of dynamic return

This applies if a student has one of the following:

- `if (parameter === 'Alice')`
- `if (parameter === 'Bob')`

In each case, they have a _shameless green_ solution, meaning that it passes the
test, but not the _intent_. In this case explain that Alice and Bob are
examples, but the function should work with _any_ name.

#### Conditionals

This applies if a student has one of the following:

- `if (expression)`
- `expression ? consequent : alternate`
- `literal || 'you'`

In each case, they're handling the fact that sometimes a name is not passed in.
Suggest they use a [default value][ref-default-value] for the parameter (usually
called `name`).

#### String concatenation

This applies if a student does _not_ use a [template literal][ref-template-literal]

- `'One for ' + name + ', one for me'`

This is the perfect time to point them towards templated string literals and how
to interpolate values.

#### CommonJS exports

This applies if the student does _not_ use ES6 style exports:

- `module.exports = { twoFer }`

Explain that we use babel, and this allows the student to use all new language
features. They may use ES6 style `export`. as well as any other ES6 feature. If
this is the **only** comment, approve but give this suggestion for future
exercises.

### Talking points

- The difference of intent between a default value and using a falsy logical or
  (`name || 'you'`). What happens when the input is `null`, what happens when
  the input is `''`, what happens when the input is ... `0`?
- The difference between `===` and `==`, `!==` and `!=` ([equality comparisons and sameness][ref-equality]).
  You should suggest they always use strict equality, but since the optimal
  solution doesn't have a conditional, it does not apply to this exercise.
- On exercism there is no need for [defensive programming][wiki-defensive-programming].
  This means they should not test if the input is a string, or something else
  unforeseen. The test cases should indicate what a function might be called
  with.
- Public API should have return types, because they save you from making
  accidental mistakes. If you expect the function to return a string, mark it as
  such.
- Even if you have a default value applied to your parameter, mark its type even
  though it currently can be inferred. This allows you to later remove the
  default type and not run into issues (either it will then be `any` or you'll
  get an error `no-implicit-any`).
