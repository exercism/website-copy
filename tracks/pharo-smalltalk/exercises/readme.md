## Notes

Unlike other tracks, Pharo has an IDE built in itself, and so mentoring tools have been built into Pharo to retrieve user exercises and create feedback notes.

Mentor notes are therefore available on the comment tab of the Test class for each exercise. If you are a mentor, please follow the instructions for loading the [Pharo Exercism development environment](https://github.com/exercism/pharo-smalltalk), and refer to the aforementioned comments in each exercise.
