New concepts: Array query methods (+ chaining methods), instantiating a class, writing and calling(!) a getter method or `attr_reader`.

### Minimal solution for approval

```ruby

class HighScores
  def initialize(scores)
    @scores = scores
  end

  def scores
    @scores
  end

  def personal_best
    scores.max
  end

  def latest
    scores.last
  end

  def personal_top
    scores.sort.reverse.take(3) 
  end

  def report
    difference = "#{personal_best - latest} short of" unless personal_best == latest

    "Your latest score was #{latest}. That's #{difference} your personal best!".squeeze(' ')
  end
end

```
### Reasonable variants
 - Using `attr_reader :scores` instead of the getter method `scores`: Is better, but no need to point them to `attr_reader` if they write the method `scores`. 
 - Variants in composing the string in `report`, as long as it's not a complicated if/else statement (see Talking Points).
 - Using helper methods for `report` and make those helper methods `private`.

### General 
- The Instructions point to a beginner friendly explanation of instantiating a class: 
[Ruby for Beginners](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_classes/initializers.html)
and to the rubydocs [Array](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Array.html). 
- `sort.reverse` is not very performant, but at this point in the track it's more important that students explore the 
standard libraries (and work with method chaining) than that they know how to optimize.

### Talking points
- `@scores` vs `scores`: This is the most important issue in this exercise. Beginners may _write_ the getter method/attr_reader, but _call_ the instance variable `@scores` still.
This link explains: [launchschool: accessor_methods](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/classes_and_objects_part1#accessormethods). It's recommended to link to this or your favorite explanation, instead of typing the solution for them. 
- `scores.max(3)`: `Array#max` [takes an argument](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Array.html#method-i-max).
- `Array#[]`: Most submissions retrieve the `personal_top` values with the `Array#[]` method, which is harder to read than the convenience methods that Ruby offers: `Array#take(3)` or `Array#first(3)` win in readability. And `Array#max(3)` doesn't even need the sorting-and-reverting steps. 
- `report`: The `report` method asks for a conditionally composed string. It's meant to think about the trade-off 'duplication' vs 'readability'. Recommendation: approve any solution unless it's a supercomplicated if/else statement. 
- `spaces`: Consider `String#squeeze(' ')` to avoid hard-to-spot spacing in string interpolation. 

### Mentor Research
- [String](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html): `String#<< / String.concat` vs. `String#+`? 
Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place, `String#+` creates new string objects.
Ruby 2.3 will freeze string literals by default.

### Changelog
- Version 2 changed method names "highest" -> "personal_best", "top" -> "personal_top"
