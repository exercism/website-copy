New concepts: Array query methods (+ chaining methods), instantiating a class, writing and calling(!) a getter method or `attr_reader`.

### Minimal solution for approval

```ruby

class HighScores
  def initialize(scores)
    @scores = scores
  end

  def scores
    @scores
  end

  def personal_best
    scores.max
  end

  def latest
    scores.last
  end

  def personal_top_three
    scores.sort.reverse.take(3) 
  end
  
  def latest_is_personal_best?
    latest == personal_best
  end
end

```
### Reasonable variants
 - Using `attr_reader :scores` instead of the getter method `scores` is better, but no need to point them to `attr_reader` if they write the method `scores`.
 
### General 
- The instructions point to a beginner friendly explanation of instantiating a class: [Ruby for Beginners](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_classes/initializers.html). They also point to the Ruby docs for [Array](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Array.html). 
- `sort.reverse` is not very performant, but at this point in the track it's more important that students explore the standard libraries (and work with method chaining) than that they know how to optimize.

### Talking points
- `@scores` vs `scores`: This is the most important issue in this exercise. Beginners may _write_ the getter method/`attr_reader`, but _call_ the instance variable `@scores` still. This link explains some of the advantages of using the getter method internally in the class instead of directly referencing the instance variable: [LaunchSchool: accessor_methods](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/classes_and_objects_part1#accessormethodsinaction). It's recommended to link to this or your favorite explanation, instead of typing the solution for them. 
- `latest_is_personal_best?`: this predicate method should use the existing methods, and implicitly return true or false. For new programmers it may be helpful to ask what they think the question mark indicates.   
- `scores.max(3)`: `Array#max` [takes an argument](https://ruby-doc.org/core/Array.html#method-i-max).
- `Array#[]`: Most submissions retrieve the `personal_top_three` values with the `Array#[]` method, which is harder to read than the convenience methods that Ruby offers. `Array#take(3)` or `Array#first(3)` win in readability. And `Array#max(3)` doesn't even need the sorting-and-reverting steps. 

### Changelog
- Version 5 added a boolean/predicate method `latest_is_personal_best?` (See https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/pull/1564) 
- Version 3/4 changed method names "personal_top" -> "personal_top_three" and removed the "report" method. (See related Mentor Notes [here](https://github.com/exercism/website-copy/blob/aa66a176756313687baf214bbb051e1c3fc0f832/tracks/ruby/exercises/high-scores/mentoring.md).)
- Version 2 changed method names "highest" -> "personal_best", "top" -> "personal_top".
