### Reasonable solutions
#### Array Based
``` 
public static class ResistorColor
{
    private static readonly string[] resistorColors = { "black", "brown", "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "grey", "white" };

    public static int ColorCode(string color) => System.Array.IndexOf(resistorColors, color);

    public static string[] Colors() => resistorColors;
}
```
#### Dictionary Based
Based on Horatiu's solution
```
ï»¿using System.Collections.Generic;
 using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
 using System.Linq;
  
 public static class ResistorColor
 {
     private static ReadOnlyDictionary<string, int> colors = new ReadOnlyDictionary<string, int>(new Dictionary<string, int>
     {
         {"black", 0},
         {"brown", 1},
         {"red" , 2},
         {"orange", 3},
         {"yellow", 4},
         {"green", 5},
         {"blue", 6},
         {"violet", 7},
         {"grey", 8},
         {"white", 9}
     });
 
     public static int ColorCode(string color)
     {
         return colors[color];
     }
 
     public static string[] Colors()
     {
         return colors.Keys.ToArray();
     }
 }
```
#### Enum Based
```
using System;

public static class ResistorColor
{
    enum Color
    {
        black,
        brown,
        red,
        orange,
        yellow,
        green,
        blue,
        violet,
        grey,
        white
        
    }
    public static int ColorCode(string color)
    {
        return (int)Enum.Parse(typeof(Color), color);
    }

    public static string[] Colors()
    {
        return Enum.GetNames(typeof(Color));        
    }
}
```
### Common suggestions
* Enum version: If users will be inputting or reading-out number values for the
resistors than it might be more expressive to assign the numbers to
the enums to show that the actual values are important. 
* Array version: consider cloning the array on return from `Colors()` as
a defensive measure.  This will prevent a user of the class from
accidentally overwriting the values.
### Talking points
* This may or may not be the place to handle the letter case of the colors.
* Array version: students are frequently calling `Colors()` from
`ColorCode()` and newing the array there each time.  This does not 
give optimal performance.
* Dictionary version: The returned dictionary should be read only as 
a defensive measure.  This will prevent a user of the class from
accidentally overwriting the values.
* Arguably the most maintainable solution would be a dictionary mapping
string color names to explicit enums.  This would apply if both color
names and color values had a role outside of the program.  `enum`s could 
be used within the code.  This,
of course, sacrifices simplicity.
