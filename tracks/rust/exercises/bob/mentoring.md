- [constant](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html)

### Reasonable Solutions

A reasonable solution should:

- Use constants
- Use variables
- Use `match` statements
- Check if the input string is empty and return the "FINE" constant
before doing any additional processing
- Use simple methods from the standard library
- Not use the regex crate

#### Examples

```rust
const SURE: &str = "Sure.";
const WHOA: &str = "Whoa, chill out!";
const CALM: &str = "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!";
const FINE: &str = "Fine. Be that way!";
const WHATEVER: &str = "Whatever.";

#[allow(clippy::match_bool)]
pub fn reply(message: &str) -> &str {
    let trimmed: &str = message.trim();

    match trimmed.is_empty() {
        true => FINE,
        false => {
            let is_question: bool = trimmed.ends_with("?");

            let contains_alphabetic_characters: bool = trimmed.chars().any(|character| character.is_alphabetic());
            let is_uppercase: bool = trimmed == trimmed.to_uppercase();
            let is_yelled: bool = contains_alphabetic_characters && is_uppercase;

            match (is_question, is_yelled) {
                (true, false) => SURE,
                (false, true) => WHOA,
                (true, true) => CALM,
                (false, false) => WHATEVER,
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Variations of `is_yelled` can also include using a `chars()` loop to ensure no extra `String` is allocated.

### Common Suggestions

If they don't use a constant:
```
We can improve this by setting our output strings to be [constants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html)
```

If they don't create a trimmed variable or use something other than `.trim()`:
```
Have a look at the `.trim()` method.
```

If they check if the string is empty in any other way than `.is_empty()`:
```
Well done you for seeing that we need to check if the string is empty with `== ""`. There's actually a method, `.is_empty()`, that we can use instead, which is much cleaner.
```

If they use `if` statements, you can alternatively suggest that they try out using `match`:
```
Check out using `match` instead of `if`. For some things, like destructuring, it's required. It's an idiom specific to Rust, so I always default to it unless the logic is comparing many different things and a match in that case makes it messy.
```

Similarly, if they use an `if` on their `.is_empty()` check, you can offer that they use `match`:

````md
See about doing a  `match`, instead of `if`, on `your_trimmed_variable.is_empty()`. And, if it's `true`, instantly output our "Fine. Be that way!" constant. Then, everything else will be in the `false` arm.
Like this:
```rust
match your_trimmed_variable.is_empty() {
    true => FINE,
    false => {
```
Be aware that if you use Clippy, it will tell you that it is improper, it's purely a stylistic choice. We can tell Clippy to allow it with `#[allow(clippy::match_bool)]`.
````

If they are struggling with how to check if it's a question or use something like `chars().last()`:
```
Have a look at [`.ends_with()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.ends_with) to check if it's a question, it's much cleaner.
```

If they use regex:
```
This is good! Great idea using the regex crate! Let's look at how to do this with just the standard library.
```
Then note the following:
```
See about finding a way to check if it's alphabetic without using regex.
```

If they use separate functions:
```
We don't need to create separate functions here. We can put this all in one by setting these calls to variables instead.
```

If they don't use a `match` to compare the conditions:
````md
We can `match` on just two conditions: `is_question` and `is_yelling`. Like this:
```rust
match (is_question, is_yelling) {
    (true, false) => SURE,
    ...
```
````

If they put their constants inside the function:
```
Note that it's common convention to put constants at the beginning of a file like I've done above. If it's a public constant, which is typical, we put it following our `use` lines, along with `struct`s and `enum`s. If it's a private constant, we put it at the beginning of the scope of the function. But, either way doesn't affect the performance or functionality!
```

If they ask about `&str` having a static lifetime in comparison to using constants:
```
To quote from [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime/static_lifetime.html): "When `static_string` goes out of scope, the reference can no longer be used, but the data remains in the binary."

What I think the compiler is doing is recreating the pointer to the static data if we use a plain `let` line, whereas with `const`, the data and the pointer are always kept alive.

Also, the use of `const` allows us to have it globally scopable.
```

If they use `_` instead of `false` in their match statement:
```
Using the `_` in the true/false `match` suggests that there's something else to catch while there isn't. This makes it less readable and can even be a source of bugs in some cases. So, we should limit its use to only when it's needed. Here, we should use `false` because there is no other option.
```
