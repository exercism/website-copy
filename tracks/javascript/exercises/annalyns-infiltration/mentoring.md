# Mentoring

### Common suggestions

- Several students compare variable to `true`, so it might be a good opportunity to introduce them the concept of truthy and falsy, you can always use these references from MDN or any preference of choice for [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy).
- Some students get confused with the story and can't keep track of conditions and they end up with more conditions than they need, it's a good opportunity to guide to find the exact conditions they need to solve this exercise.
Most fail at `canFreePrisoner` and they add a lot of conditions, you can help them to realise that there is only 2 conditions.
