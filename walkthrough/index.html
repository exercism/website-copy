This guide was created in order to help you get started learning with Exercism. Answer a few questions, follow a few instructions, and you should be ready in no time!

To make better use of the guide, here's a brief outline of how this guide is structured:

- This guide is composed of several tutorials. These outline the steps needed to get Exercism installed. Inside each tutorial are step-by-step instructions to get Exercism running, as well as steps to verify whether you've done the right thing.

- At the end of each tutorial, we ask a question in order to track your progress. This helps us to point you to the next installation step.

That being said, let's start with our first question!

---
## Which OS do you use?

- [[Linux-&gt;Linux Introduction]]
- [[Mac-&gt;Mac Introduction]]
- [[Windows-&gt;Windows Introduction]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Installation complete" tags="" position=""># Installation complete

Getting new people to learn with Exercism is our top priority, so please don't be afraid to reach out.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Configuring the CLI" tags="" position=""># Configuring the CLI

In order to configure the CLI, paste in the following text into your terminal:

```
[CONFIGURE_COMMAND]
```

You can find your token on your [settings page](http://exercism.io/my/settings).

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

After hitting the `Enter` key, you should see a notification from the CLI that a configuration file has been written.

### Important: The token above should be treated like a password and not be shared with anyone!

When asking for help that involves a command, remove your token before sharing the command.

---

## Have you configured the Exercism CLI on your computer?

- [[Yes-&gt;Installation complete]]
- [[No-&gt;Talk to a Volunteer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Linux architecture" tags="" position=""># Determine process architecture on Linux

To determine your process architecture, paste
in the following command into your terminal:

```
uname -m
```

Hit `Enter` after you have pasted in the command and examine the output.

## `x86_64`

If the output is `x86_64` then you are on a 64-bit architecture.

The file you are looking for is `exercism-linux-64bit.tgz`.

## `i686`

If the output is `i686` then you are on a 32-bit architecture.

The file you are looking for is `exercism-linux-32bit.tgz`.

## `armv5l`, `armv6l`, `armv7l` or `armv8l`

If the output is `armv5l`, `armv6l`, `armv7l`
or `armv8l` then you are on an ARM architecture.

The file you are looking for is `exercism-linux-arm-v5.tgz`,
`exercism-linux-arm-v6.tgz`, `exercism-linux-arm-v7.tgz`
or `exercism-linux-arm-v8.tgz` (respectively).

## Other

If your output does not match any of the above, try the
snap package or talk to a volunteer if snap is not an option for you.

## Do you know your system’s process architecture?

- [[Yes-&gt;Linux tarball]]
- [[No, I would like to try the snap package-&gt;Linux - Snap]]
- [[No, I would like talk to a volunteer-&gt;Talk to a Volunteer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Linux directory" tags="" position=""># Moving the Executable to `~/bin`

Once you download and extract the archive, make it available in your `$PATH`.

First, let’s make sure the directory exists:

```
mkdir -p ~/bin
```

Next, let’s move the `exercism` executable there:

```
mv exercism ~/bin
```

Make sure everything worked:

```
~/bin/exercism
```

The above should output something like the below:

```

## Did running `~/bin/exercism` output something like the above?

- [[Yes-&gt;Linux path]]
- [[No-&gt;Talk to a Volunteer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Linux Introduction" tags="" position=""># Installing Exercism on Linux

You can use the [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/exercism) to install the command-line client, or install it manually. If you are unsure which one to choose, try using snap first. More information is available in the next section.

- [[Using the source code-&gt;Linux tarball]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Linux path" tags="" position=""># Adding `~/bin` to `$PATH` in Bash

Note: If you’re not running Bash try to adjust the
below to your shell or [[Talk to a Volunteer-&gt;Talk to a Volunteer]].

To have the `exercism` executable available everywhere on the
command line you need to make sure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

There is a chance it’s there already; let’s see whether it is:

```
[[ ":$PATH:" == *":$HOME/bin:"* || ":$PATH:" == *":~/bin:"* ]] &amp;&amp; echo "~/bin is in PATH" || echo "~/bin is not in PATH"
```

If the above prints `~/bin is not in PATH` let’s add
`~/bin` to `$PATH` and reload Bash configuration:

```
echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

To check whether this worked, try to run `exercism` without providing the path:

```
exercism
```

The above should output something like the below:

## Download the archive

If you know your process architecture (x86 (32-bit) vs x86_64 (64-bit) vs ARM), download the appropriate archive from the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/exercism/cli/releases/latest" target="_blank"&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt;.


## Extract from the archive

Once you have the archive downloaded you
need to extract the executable from it.

* If you’re using a graphic interface (e.g., GNOME or
Unity on Ubuntu): go to your downloads directory, right
click on the downloaded file and select _Extract Here_.

* If you’re using the command line (use the
right archive file name for your architecture):
```
tar -xf exercism-linux-64bit.tgz
```

## Have you installed Exercism on your computer?

- [[Yes-&gt;CLI Installation complete]]
- [[No, I'll try installing via source code-&gt;Linux tarball]]
- [[No, I need some help-&gt;Talk to a Volunteer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Mac Introduction" tags="" position=""># Installing Exercism on a Mac

You can use the Homebrew package manager to install the command-line client, or install it manually.
Both methods involve using the command-line.

Are you comfortable installing and executing programs in the terminal?

- [[Yes-&gt;Installing Exercism on a Mac - Expert]]
- [[No-&gt;Installing Exercism on a Mac]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Opening the Terminal on a Mac" tags="" position=""># Opening the Terminal on a Mac

The first step in installing Exercism is opening the terminal on your Mac. The terminal is a program which allows us to send commands to our computer via text.

Let's get started by opening the terminal!

---

## Step 1: Opening Spotlight Access

To open Spotlight Access, click the magnifying glass on the top right corner of your screen.

![Clicking the magnifying glass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/clicking_the_magnifying_glass.png)

To confirm whether Spotlight Access was successfully opened, you should see a search bar appear on your screen. When it appears, try typing into it, too!

![Spotlight access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/spotlight_access.png)

## Step 2

To open the terminal, type in the following text into Spotlight Access:

```
terminal
```

&gt; Sidenote: This tutorial contains more of these. Whenever you see text surrounded by a box, it means that you need to type in or copy and paste the text in the box. We recommend the latter to avoid typos.

![Typing terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/typing_terminal.gif)

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

To confirm whether the terminal was successfully opened, you should see a new window appear on your screen.

![Terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/terminal.png)

## Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial without any problems, you've successfully opened the terminal! You could try typing into it and see how you could send commands to your computer.

---

## Were you able to open the terminal?

- [[Yes-&gt;Verifying Homebrew Installation]]
- [[No-&gt;Open the Terminal on a Mac - Troubleshooting]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Open the Terminal on a Mac - Troubleshooting" tags="" position=""># Open the Terminal on a Mac - Troubleshooting
Having problems opening the terminal on your Mac? You might find a solution to your problem below.

## Were you able to open the Terminal?

- [[Yes-&gt;Verifying Homebrew Installation]]
- [[No-&gt;Talk to a Volunteer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Asking about Homebrew" tags="" position=""># Installing Homebrew on a Mac

Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and it makes the whole Exercism installation process easier.

Do you already have Homebrew installed?

- [[Yes-&gt;Installing Exercism via Homebrew]]
- [[I don't know-&gt;Verifying Homebrew Installation]]
- [[No-&gt;Installing Homebrew]]
- [[I want to install Exercism manually-&gt;Manual Installation on a Mac]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Verifying Homebrew Installation" tags="" position=""># Installing Homebrew on a Mac

Great! Now that you've opened the terminal on your Mac, we need to install Homebrew next. Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and installing it makes the whole Exercism installation process easier. If you want to Exercism manually, [[Manual Installation on a Mac-&gt;Manual Installation on a Mac]] would be helpful.

Since Homebrew is pretty common on Macs, let's first verify whether you have it on your computer.

---

## Step 1

To verify if homebrew is installed, type in the following text into your terminal:

```
brew
```

&gt; Sidenote: This tutorial contains more of these. Whenever you see text surrounded by a box, it means that you need to type in or copy and paste the text in the box. We recommend the latter to avoid typos.


![Clicking the magnifying glass](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/clicking_the_magnifying_glass.png)

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

After hitting the `Enter` key, your terminal should give you a reply.

### Homebrew is not installed

When you see the following reply, it means that Homebrew isn't installed on your Mac yet.

![Homebrew not installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/homebrew_not_installed.png)

&gt; Sidenote: This reply means that the terminal doesn't understand the `brew` command. Your terminal may reply with a different text, but if it means that the `brew` command isn't understood, it still means that homebrew isn't installed.

### Homebrew is installed

When you see the following reply, it means that Homebrew is installed.

![Homebrew installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/homebrew_installed.png)

&gt; Sidenote: This reply means that the terminal understands the `brew` command. Your terminal replies with examples of how the `brew` command can be used. Again, the text can vary from terminal to terminal, but the underlying principle should be that the terminal understands the `brew` command.

## Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial, you should be able to determine whether you've installed Homebrew or not.

---

## Do you have Homebrew installed?

- [[Yes-&gt;Installing Exercism via Homebrew]]
- [[No-&gt;Installing Homebrew]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Installing Homebrew" tags="" position=""># Installing Homebrew

If you would like to read more on Homebrew before installing it, the &lt;a href="https://brew.sh" target="_blank"&gt;Homebrew webpage&lt;/a&gt; is a good resource.

---

## Step 1

Paste in the following text into your terminal:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

After hitting the `Enter` key, you should see that the terminal prompts you to confirm installation.

![Confirming brew installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/confirming_brew_installation.png)

## Step 2

Hit the `Enter` key to confirm the `homebrew` installation.

After hitting the `Enter` key, the terminal prompts you to confirm again by typing in your password.

![Input password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/input_password.png)

## Step 3

Type in your password in the terminal and hit `Enter`.

&gt; Sidenote: If it's your first time doing this, you might be confused that as you are typing, nothing appears. This is a security feature of the terminal. Just keep on typing and press `Enter` when you finish.

### Incorrect password was typed in

You will see a message that an incorrect password was typed in. First, try to verify if you've typed your password correctly. If it still doesn't work, it may be the case that the password you have isn't the administrator's password. It would be good to ask your administrator to put in the password for you.

### Correct password was typed in

Your terminal should now reply saying that the `homebrew` installation has started. It may look something like this:

![Homebrew installing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/homebrew_installing.png)

## Step 4

Since `homebrew` is still installing at this point, the only need thing we need to do is wait. It may take at most 5 minutes.

### Installation is successful

After waiting, your terminal must respond with a message saying that the Homebrew installation is complete. It may look something like this:

![Homebrew install confirmation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/homebrew_install_confirmation.png)

### Installation isn't successful

If you don't seem to see a message confirming that homebrew is installed, we first recommend to check whether your internet connection is up. The installation process requires it. If your connection is up, we recommend running the install process again.

## Wrapping up

Once you've reached the end of this tutorial, you should've installed Homebrew on your computer.

You've made it to the last step! Since we've got the parts to install Exercism, it shouldn't be long before you start your learning journey with Exercism.


---

## Step 1

Paste in the following text into your terminal:

```
brew install exercism
```

![Installing Exercism](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/installing_exercism.gif)

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

### Installation started

After hitting the `Enter` key, you should see that the terminal starts to install Exercism. Since this proccess takes time, we need to wait until it finishes.

![Confirming installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/confirming_installation.png)

### Installation finished

The installation is finished once you see this message on your terminal:

![Pouring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/pouring.png)

&gt; Sidenote: The message on your terminal doesn't need to exactly match the screenshot. If you see the message "Pouring...", that should be enough.

### Installation taking too long

If your installation is taking too long, we recommend checking your internet connection. If your internet connection is up, we recommend trying to run the command again. It might work this time!

## Step 2

In order to verify whether exercism was successfully installed, paste the following text into your terminal.

```
exercism
```

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

### Installation successful

After hitting the `Enter` key, the terminal should reply with how the `exercism` command can be used.

![Exercism usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/exercism_usage.png)

&gt; Sidenote: As you get the hang of Exercism, you'll get to know more about the commands.

### Installation unsuccessful

After hitting the `Enter` key, the terminal still doesn't recognize the `exercism` command.

![Exercism not installed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/exercism_not_installed.png)

&gt; Sidenote: The messages might vary per computer, but if the message you receive means that the terminal couldn't understand the `exercism` command, you have to try installing again.

If you've encountered this, we recommend trying to install again. It might work this time!

## Wrapping up

Once you've reached the end of this tutorial, you should've installed Exercism on your computer.

The first step in installing Exercism manually is to determine your Mac's processor architecture. For this step, we need to use the terminal. If you need instructions on how to open the terminal, [[Opening the Terminal on a Mac]] would be helpful.

Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Determining processor architecture

To determine your processor architecture, paste in the following command into your Mac:

```
uname -m | if grep -q 64; then echo "64-bit CPU"; else echo "32-bit CPU"; fi
```

Hit `Enter` after you've pasted in the command.

### 32-bit processor architecture

If you're on a 32-bit processor architecture, your Terminal would reply with this:

![32-bit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/32_bit.png)

### 64-bit processor architecture

If you're on a 64-bit processor architecture, your Terminal would reply with this:

![64-bit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/64_bit.png)

### Unknown architecture

If your output doesn't match any of the above, click on "I don't know" below and we could recommend steps to help you.

In your terminal, paste in the following to create the `bin` folder:

```
mkdir -p ~/bin
```

![Create bin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/create_bin.png)

To verify if the `bin` folder is created, paste the following command in your terminal:

```
if [ -d ~/bin ]; then echo "folder created"; else echo "folder not created"; fi
```

### Folder created

Your terminal should reply with the following message when the folder was created:

![Folder created](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/folder_created.png)

### Folder not created

Your terminal should reply with the following message when the folder was not created:

![Folder not created](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/mac/folder_not_created.png)

## Step 2

Once the folder was created, paste in the following command in your terminal to move the exercism program to the `bin` folder:

```
mv ~/Downloads/exercism ~/bin
```

To verify whether you've moved the exercism program correctly, paste in the following command to your terminal:

```
if [ -f ~/bin/exercism ]; then echo "file moved"; else echo "file not moved"; fi
```

### File moved

After pasting in the command, your terminal must reply with `file moved` if the file was moved.

### File not moved

After pasting in the command, your terminal must reply with `file not moved` if the file was moved.

## Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial without any problems, you should've created a `bin` folder and moved the exercism program into it!

In order to for us to run the exercism program from anywhere in our terminal, we need to add its location to the $PATH variable.

---

## Step 1

In your terminal, paste in the following to create the `bin` folder:

```
echo "export PATH=~/bin:$PATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
```

To verify if the `$PATH` variable was updated, paste the following command in your terminal:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Next, paste the following command in your terminal:

```
exercism
```

### Variable updated successfully

If the terminal replies with instructions on how to use the exercism program, you've installed exercism successfully! Give yourself a pat on the back.

### Variable not updated

If the terminal replies saying that the exercism command is not found, it means that the variable wasn't updated.

## Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial without any problems, you have installed exercism successfully!

To determine your processor architecture, run:

```
uname -m
```

If you see `x86_64` as output, this means that your processor architecture is 64 bit.

## Unknown architecture

Nowadays, the majority of the new (newer than 3 years) PCs are using a 64 bit architecture.
Also, all computers with more than 4 GB of memory has to have a 64 bit processor architecture.

To install exercism via Homebrew run:

```
brew update &amp;&amp; brew install exercism
```

To install manually, download the appropriate version of exercism based on your processor architecture at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/exercism/cli/releases/latest" target="_blank"&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt;, then extract the archive and put the binary in your path.

Check the installed version with:

```
exercism version
```

To make the Exercism CLI usable on your computer, we need to move the `exercism` executable file to the correct folder. Using the Command Prompt we just opened, we are going to open the folder.

## Step 1: Opening the right folder

In the Command Prompt window, copy &amp; paste:

```
start "" "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps"
```

and hit the 'Enter' key.

A new window, showing a folder, will show up. This is where we need to place the `exercism` file. It will look something like this, but it might not be empty for you.

![cmd.exe folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/windows/win10-cmd-folder.png)


## Step 2: Moving the `exercism` file

Find the `exercism` file in the folder we opened earlier, when we downloaded `exercism`. From this folder, drag the file (or copy &amp; paste it) to the folder we just opened, labeled `WindowsApps`.

In the `WindowsApps` folder, you should now see the `exercism` file. It will look something like this:

![cmd.exe folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/exercism/interactive-cli-walkthrough/master/contents/assets/windows/win10-result.png)


## Step 3: Verify installation

Now that we moved the file, we need to check our installation. Open up the Command Prompt window again, and type (or copy &amp; paste):

```
exercism
```

and hit the 'Enter' key.

After hitting the `Enter` key, the Command Prompt should reply with how the `exercism` command can be used.
