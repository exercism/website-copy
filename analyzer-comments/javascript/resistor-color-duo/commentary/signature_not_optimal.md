# signature not optimal

If you look at the tests, the function `value` only receives one parameter. 
Nothing more and nothing less. The student has additional parameters declared in 
their function, but that value will always be `undefined` or whatever default 
they've assigned. Help them get rid of the extraneous parameters.
