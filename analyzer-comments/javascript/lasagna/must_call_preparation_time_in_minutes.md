# must call preparation time in minutes

Change `%{target}` so it calls `%{function}`.

According to the instructions, `%{target}` can be implemented by taking the preparation time in minutes and adding the amount of time spent in the oven.
The preparation time in minutes is the result of calling `%{function}`.

In JavaScript a function can be executed using `()`, with any arguments comma-separated between the opening parenthesis `(` and closing parenthesis `)`.
