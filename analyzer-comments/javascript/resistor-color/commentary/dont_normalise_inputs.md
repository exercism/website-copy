# dont normalise inputs

It's reasonable to be defensive about inputs, so that a program will run
correctly under more circumstances. However, arbitrary input normalization is
discouraged on Exercism. Later exercises will have defined inputs that are
denormalized where we'll expect sanitizing and normalizing the input. Keep it
simple for now.
