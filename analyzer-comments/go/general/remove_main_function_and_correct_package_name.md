# remove main function and correct package name

Remove the `main` function, rename the package name back to `twofer` and run the tests.

A `main` function is used as an entry point to a program. Exercism is using TDD ([Test Driven Development](http://testfirst.org/about#tdd)).
That means the code is executed by running the tests to make them pass. To run the tests use `go test` from the terminal.
The tests will pass if the functionality is implemented correctly.
