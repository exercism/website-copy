# use multiple clause functions

[comment]: # (The intention behind this comment is to tell people to use multiple clause functons, but because it's very hard to write good analysis for that, it instead checks for usages of if, case, and cond)

The purpose of this exercise is to teach multiple clause functions. Solve it without using `if`, `case`, or `cond`. Define multiple clauses of the `compare` function instead.
