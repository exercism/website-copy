# do not use list functions

Please don't use any external modules (like List, Enum or Stream) in your
implementation. The point of this exercise is to create these basic
functions yourself. You may use basic Kernel functions (like `Kernel.+/2`
for adding numbers), but please do not use Kernel functions for Lists like
`++`, `--`, `hd`, `tl`, `in`, `for` and `length`.
