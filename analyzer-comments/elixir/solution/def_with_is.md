Elixir has specific naming conventions which include how to name [functions that return a boolean](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/naming-conventions.html#trailing-question-mark-foo):

> Functions that return a boolean are named with a trailing question mark.

```elixir
# this is the expected name of functions that return a boolean

%{expected}

# this is the current name

%{actual}
```

Note that guards, some built-in functions and macros that return booleans and are valid in guards follow another convention and are named with a `is_` prefix (`def is_integer`, `defguard is_foo`, `defmacro is_foo`). Both conventions must not mix.
