# use module doc

[comment]: # (This error is raised when the submission lacks @moduledoc for the Module)

It is recommended to have a [`@moduledoc`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/writing-documentation.html#module-attributes) attribute to describe the intent of the module.

- Documentation is a [first-class citizen](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/writing-documentation.html) in Elixir -- Elixir's documentation is designed to be easy to read and write.
- Markdown syntax is supported inside of documentation attributes `@moduledoc` and `@doc`
