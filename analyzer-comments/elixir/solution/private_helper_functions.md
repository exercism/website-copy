# private helper functions

The public interface of a codebase should be carefully considered. Each public function increases long term maintenance cost because it can be used anywhere in the project. The more times a function is used, the more work it takes to change that function.

In every Exercism exercise, the public interface is defined by the test suite. If a function is being tested, it needs to the public. All other functions should be private.

```elixir
# this is a private function

%{expected}

# this is a public function

%{actual}
```

Note that when writing a library, it is often necessary to make functions public for use among modules. To hide such functions from the documentation, add `@doc false` before the function definitions or `@moduledoc false` to hide the whole module.
