# private helper functions

The public interface of a codebase should be carefully considered. Each public function increases long term maintenance cost because it can be used anywhere in the project. The more times a function is used, the more work it takes to change that function.

In this exercise, the public interface has already been provided by the stub file. All other functions should be private.

```elixir
# this is a private function

%{expected}

# this is a public function

%{actual}
```

Note that when writing a library, it is often necessary to make functions public for use among modules. To hide such functions from the documentation and from library users, add `@doc false` before each function definition.
