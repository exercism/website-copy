# last line assignment

You have assigned a variable on the last line of a function definition. This is unnecessary since there is no way to use the variable.

Please note that an assignment on the last line may sometimes falsely trigger other analyzer comments. If you see other comments that don't make sense, start with removing the variable assignment.
