# indentation

Elixir code should be indented with 2 spaces. Make sure not to use tabs for indentation.

If you are solving Elixir exercises on your own computer, consider running `mix format` in the directory with the exercise. It will automatically format your code according to the community's standards, including fixing all problems with indentation.
