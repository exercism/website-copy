# incorrect uniqueTreasures signature

The signature for `uniqueTreasures` is not what is expected.
The instructions say:

> `uniqueTreasures` should take a `List Chest` without specific conditions and return a `List Chest`, with the extra condition `uniqueTreasure : ()` added to the phantom record.
