# do not use division or modulo

Like the instructions mention, the purpose of this exercise is to build a Sieve of Eratosthenes without the use of operations such as division or modulo division.
Please refer to the [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) for a description of the algorithm.

Building the Sieve of Eratosthenes in an immutable language such as Elm may feel a bit unnatural, but it is a beautiful algorithm invented more than two millennia ago that is worth learning and implementing correctly.
