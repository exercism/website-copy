# do not use `%` or `/`

Like the instructions mention, the purpose of this exercise is to build a Sieve of Eratosthenes without the use of operations such as division or modulo division.
Please refer to the [Wikipedia link][wikipedia] for a description of the algorithm.

Building the Sieve of Eratosthenes in an immutable language such as Crystal may feel a bit unnatural,
but it is a beautiful algorithm invented more than two millennia ago that is worth learning and implementing.
