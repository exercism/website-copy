# function not optimal

It looks like `%{function}` is not optimal.
This analyzer is a Work In Progress and can't tell you exactly why it thinks something is not optimal.
Feel free to ignore this feedback.
If you wish to attempt to resolve it, the advice is as follows: this function is expected to be as simple as possible, without
declaring any extra variables.
