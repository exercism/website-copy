# signature changed

Do not change the function declarations unless absolutely necessary.
The stub provides the correct `exports` and correct `function` declarations, with the expected amount and format of parameters.
It is sometimes possible to change the function signature (change how its parameters work), but in this case the parameters were already optimally defined.
