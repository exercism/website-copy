Use `${'literal.type'}` instead of the boxed type `${'boxed.type'}`. In
TypeScript, the types `Object`, `Number`, `Boolean` and `String` are types which
refer to non-primitive boxed objects that are almost never used appropriately in
TypeScript or JavaScript code. Read more about boxing [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_type_(object-oriented_programming)#Boxing).
