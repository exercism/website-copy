# use null coalescing operator not null check

Use the [null-coalescing operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/null-coalescing-operator) to simplify your code, rather than explicitly checking for a value to equal `null` and then doing something with it.
