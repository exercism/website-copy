# pylint informational


**Line %{lineno}** [_%{code}_]  :  %{message} was reported by Pylint.

There is `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` style comment or other "informational" pattern or note in the code.
 These tags are often used to annotate places where code is stubbed out but needs work - or to highlight potential design flaws or bugs that need to be addressed in the future.
