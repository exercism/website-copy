# general missing return statement

A `return` statement is not being used in this function to return results.
 This code should have failed one or more test cases during testing.

Please review the test results, and edit the code accordingly.

If you have not yet run the tests for this exercise, please do so now by issuing the command ```run pytest``` inside the problem exercise directory (e.g. `exercism/python/<exercise-name>/`).
This will give you a list of which test cases passed or failed.
